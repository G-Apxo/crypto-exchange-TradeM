        <b> The Biggest Crypto Bull Cycle Is UponUs: Bernstein</b>
    </h2>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 25px;"">
    <p> FTX’s collapse was the catalyst for a new
        bullish cycle in cryptocurrency markets, 
        brokerage firm Bernstein said in a research
        report Monday. The crypto exchange’s demise 
        cleaned up the final tranche of “toxic 
        crypto leverage” and taught digital-asset 
        investors the importance of decentralization
        and self-custody wallets, the report said.”
